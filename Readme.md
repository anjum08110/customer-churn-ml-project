# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to predict customer churn based on customer demographics,
service usage, and contract details using supervised machine learning models.

## Dataset
Telco Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression (Baseline)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

## Key Results
Random Forest achieved the best performance with improved recall, making it suitable
for churn prediction where identifying potential churners is critical.

## Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Handling class imbalance
- Model deployment using FastAPI
